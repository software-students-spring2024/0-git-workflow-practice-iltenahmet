# Article: [The Grug Brained Developer](https://grugbrain.dev/)

The main point of the article is to recognize your own stupidity before shooting yourself in the foot. Since we have a million different ways of building the same software as engineeers, it is too easy to introduce million different ways of unnecessary complexity that undermines the development process. The article offers advice on more specific topics such as Agile, Testing, and Refactoring, etc. as well based on this philosophy. 

I don't have enough experience in the industry to assess whether his claims on specific topics like Agile is true or not, however, the general idea of thinking like a "self-aware smol brained" helped me in my programming journey. However, when I mean "small brained", I don't mean it in a self deprecating way. I mean it a light hearted, humorous way. The way you would way "Oh, I'm such a dummy." when you forget someting. 

The most important benefit of this approach is that it allows me to put emphasis on keeping things simple, introducing as little abstractions as possible. When I come back to the same code written months ago, I have much easier time understanding because the number of things I have to keep in my head in one moment is small.

Another important benefit is that it allows me to keep a positive mindset on failure. If you think you're already very smart. Failure, or struggling with things might damage your ego. You might not want to take on a challenging project, or a course, since it might break the facade. On the contrary, if I preemptively assume I'm dumb, a failure in a challenging course or subject won't really deter me, I'll just try to find ways my dumb little brain comprehend the subject matter. This way, I'll focus on putting more effort, or finding more effective ways of studying, and have a much higher proabability of succeeding.

I would agree that complexity is rough, but cannot consider it a demon or a t-rex, haha. When building a project, a software engineer should think about the scope and features of the project, therefore using frameworks and systems that can handle the complexity and functions of it.

maintenance and architecture of the code is very important. When building a project, and especially when making it open source, therefore opening it up to a community of developers who are interested in contributing, there must be a proper framework for the contribution system. But more importantly, there should be a proper documentation of the code, and a person, or group of people, who maintain and are responsible to filtering and going through the contributions.

Testing the code - also crucial. There are many cases when software runs on specific systems, but not on others; when it is vulnerable to SQL injections, or other types of attacks. Testing the code is crucial, and should be done by a professional, or a group of professionals, who are responsible for the testing and maintenance of the code.

Overall i think this article was written as a joke and should not be taken seriously. IT was difficult to pinpoint the serious parts vs ones that were written as a joke
